# heartSoundClassification

This project is inspired by heart sound intepretation (https://www.med.umich.edu/lrc/psb_open/html/repo/primer_heartsound/primer_heartsound.html), aimg to predict the basic heart disease based on heart sound. The machine model trained with the data from (1)2016 Phsionet challenge (https://www.physionet.org/content/challenge-2016/1.0.0/), algorithm explanation in national library of medicine (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7199391/); (2) 2022 DigiScope Phonocardiogram dataset (https://physionet.org/content/circor-heart-sound/1.0.3/)

* The data download from
* The data training with
* The reference scoring file
* The precision and recall


Future improvement:

1) continue improve the model
2) create ui allowing user to upload the sound and do prediction
