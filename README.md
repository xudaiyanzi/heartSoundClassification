# heartSoundClassification

This project is inspired by heart sound intepretation (https://www.med.umich.edu/lrc/psb_open/html/repo/primer_heartsound/primer_heartsound.html), aiming to predict the basic heart disease from the irregular heart sound . The machine model trained with the data from (1)2016 Phsionet challenge (https://www.physionet.org/content/challenge-2016/1.0.0/), algorithm explanation in national library of medicine (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7199391/); (2) 2022 DigiScope Phonocardiogram dataset (https://physionet.org/content/circor-heart-sound/1.0.3/)

* The data download from 2016 (https://archive.physionet.org/pn3/challenge/2016/) and 2022 (https://physionet.org/content/circor-heart-sound/1.0.3/#description)
* The data training with code adapted from (https://www.kaggle.com/code/jaidalmotra/physionet-challenge-heart-sound-classification) for 2016 data and (https://github.com/Bsingstad/Heart-murmur-detection-2022-Simulab) and (https://github.com/wenh06/cinc2022_paper) for 2022 data.
* The reference scoring file
* The precision and recall

Future improvement:

1) improve the model
2) create ui allowing user to upload the sound and do prediction
